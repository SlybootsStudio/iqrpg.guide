Battle
------

- Mobs/Dungeon mobs now attack first. Slightly increased their attack. Significantly decreased their defence and increased their health. Increased the chance to hit for mobs above 500 million power level.

- Added 9 new mobs to The Abyss.
- Added 12 new mobs to the Eternal Crypt.
- Mobs in Areas 1-6 now drop more gold. Area 1 had the most significant increase - the first mob now drops 170 base gold, up from 40.
- The Abyss mobs with a power level of under 1.5 million also received a gold buff.
- The chances of getting a health/attack/defence attribute increase was increased by 20% for attributes below base 1,250.

Gathering
---------

- You can now upgrade your Gathering Upgrades past level 100 (limit set to 250 but can be increased if anyone ever gets close), however the costs increase much faster past level 100.
- Gathering Upgrades are no longer limited by your Upgrade level.

Raids
-----

- The Stone Merchant is now more likely to roll a 5-7 Sandstone drop instead of a 1 Marble drop.
- Small Banks now drop 1-2 Credits instead of Gold.
- Large Banks now drop 2-4 Credits instead of Gold.

Jewelcrafting
-------------

- Gem fragments required to create a Sapphire increased to 75 (was 50).
- Exp per attempt from crafting Sapphire/Ruby/Emerald/Diamond increased to 75/110/225/1000 (was 70/100/180/600).

Runecrafting
------------

- Changed the amounts of Sandstone and Marble required to craft the following runes:
-- Rune Of The Warlord - 20 Sandstone, 7 Marble (was 25/6)
-- Rune Of The Overlord - 30 Sandstone, 15 Marble (was 50/9)
-- Greater Rune Of The Warlord - 40 Sandstone, 31 Marble (was 100/12)

Dungeoneering
-------------

- The Vault/Treasury gold rewards were replaced with a Credit reward and some adjustments were made to the other rolls.

Trinkets
--------

- Battle trinkets can now have the Double Items mod.
- Battle trinkets now have a +x% Attributes instead of rolling each one individually. If your old trinket had any attribute mods, they will receive this updated mod and their replaced mod slots will be re-rolled.
-- If your existing trinket has more than 1 attribute mod, the average of them is taken with any missing attributes being rolled into this average.
-- For new trinkets, there will be 3 rolls between 50 and 75, and the average is taken.
- You can now equip 3 Battle Trinkets and 3 Gathering Trinkets.
-- Battling/Gathering skills use their respective trinkets but for crafting skills, the highest value from either battle/gathering trinkets is used. All skills (even gathering) use the Gold Boost mod when calculating action bonus, since gathering skills do not have this modifier.

Personnel
---------

- Labyrinth Keeper personnel added. Each level increases the amount of exp gained by 1% as well as decreasing Labyrinth action timer by 0.01s. Each rarity increases Labyrinth actions by the following amounts +1/+1/+2/+3/+3 as well as decreasing labyrinth action timer by 0.1s.
- Each personnel now has a level 125 level bonus.
- The level bonuses of some personnel were changed to make them more beneficial at higher levels.
- The effects of each level of some personnel past level 100 were changed to make them more beneficial. Since there are a lot of changes here, the exact effects can be found on the personnel page.

Bosses
------

- Slightly reduced the impact of equipment on boss damage and increased the effectiveness of your natural attack level.
- The number of boss token drops is now multiplied by the number of hits you land on a boss.

Misc
----

- Clanmanship now has a 1/25,000 chance to trigger (was 1/10,000) and additionally gives between 1-5 Credits. The chances of receiving more Credits increase for every point of Clanmanship above 500.
- The announcements page now shows all past announcements instead of only the latest 10.
- Bonus Time now starts at 75% and increases by 1% for every $100 spent. The cap is now 150%. Each $1 now adds 2 minute bonus time.
- To negate the loss of bonus time, all gold/res/exp gains were increased by 30%.

NOTE: There's a display bug which shows the % attribute gain from Trinkets showing half of what it actually gives. The correct attributes are applied and the display issue will be fixed in the next patch to avoid extra downtime.
