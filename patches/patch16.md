Labyrinth
---------

- To mitigate long fail streaks, each Labyrinth room now have a progress meter that when filled will result in an automatic success. The progress meter requires approx 2x the expected attempts (a floor with a 10% chance will result in a 20 room auto completion).
- Once completing your Labyrinth run, the button to open your chest now appears on the main game interface.
- Beginning at level 91, each level gives an increasing amount of "power" (1.01 at level 91 to 1.27 at level 125) until it reverts back to 1 per level at level 125. At level 125 you now have the equivalent power of 130 previously.
- Increased the difficulty of room 1 slightly.
- Rooms with a higher difficulty are less likely to spawn before rooms of lower difficulty.
- Crafting rooms are slightly less likely to appear.

Battling
--------

- Added a new area: Eternal Crypt.
- The droptables for all areas were updated.
- Heroic Shards can be obtained when battling in higher areas. This will be used similarly to the way Heroic Potions work and will function in the upcoming patch. Untradeable until then.
- Added 2 new sets of equipment.
- The gold level bonus was increased slightly.

Gathering
---------

- Added 3 more tool levels.

Misc
----

- The maximum market price was increased to 999,999,999,999, up from 9,999,999,999.
- Preferences section now loads correctly.
