Trinkets
--------

- You can now unlock the ability to convert mythical trinkets into celestial trinkets. The costs of doing so are 75 Trinket Essence for the first unlock, then 100 and 125 for the second and third. Each unlock allows you to convert both 1 battling and 1 gathering trinket.
- Celestial Trinkets will include every mod for their respective trinket type. They can be upgraded to tier 15, but the costs of doing so are high, and get higher with each upgrade.
- Celestial Trinkets cannot be destroyed.
- Decreased the clutter of the trinket list. The cost of upgrades and what you receive from destroying a trinket is now shown when you confirm the action.

Jewelcrafting
-------------

- The chance of a perfect craft was significantly increased for lower level Jewelcrafters. Previously, there was a base chance of 10% which increased by 0.1% per level, then 0.2% for each level after 100. Now, there is a base chance of 18% which increases by 0.05% per level, then 0.2% for each level after 120.
-- Examples:
-- Level 10 now has an 18.5% chance of a perfect craft, up from 11%.
-- Level 50 now has a 20.5% chance, up from 15%.
-- Level 100 now has a 23% chance, up from 20%.

Battling
--------

- When your accuracy surpasses 100%, the additional accuracy will contribute towards a second hit. For example at 110% accuracy, your first hit will always hit and attack a second time with an accuracy of 10%. This does not work when fighting bosses.
- When your dodge surpasses 50%, the effectiveness of each point will be divided by 3, and then divided by 10 upon reaching 80% dodge. For example, at 60% dodge you would have 53.33% effective dodge. At 100% dodge you would have 62% effective dodge. The hard cap on effective dodge is 70%. This does not apply when fighting bosses, which have a 90% dodge negation on your total dodge.
- Added 22 new mobs to the Eternal Crypt. These will be moved along with the rest of the un-named mobs in a future update. Soon.
- Added 6 new mobs to the Abyss.
- Mobs in Area 9 and below now drop more gold, with the most significant increases in the lower areas.
- Slightly increased the gold gained from level bonus.
- Increased the gold from the first 15 Abyss mobs to match the gold from regular mobs.

Gathering
---------

- Added 11 new tool levels.
- Increased the Gathering Upgrade Level cap from 500 to 1,000. The cost scales higher past level 500.
- Reduced the cost of the first 5 tool levels to 1/5/25/100/300 Tool Components, from 5/25/60/150/350.

Dungeoneering
-------------

- Added an uncommon level 100 dungeon: Sunken Ruins.
- For each Dungeoneering level after 100, you have a 1% chance of any key drop from the action bonus being doubled.
- Increased the maximum number of jewel slots by 1 for each jewel type. Costs from Sapphire to Diamond are 900k/1.2m/1.5m/1.8m.

Bosses
------

- When dealing damage to a boss, you have a chance to receive whatever item the boss drops as a random drop. The chances of receiving this drop depends on your damage dealt. On average, there will be 2 item drops per boss.
- Added new Boss Token thresholds at 1.6b, 2.2b and 2.9b damage which give 10, 11 and 12 tokens.

Rushes
------

- Gold/resource rush probability changed to 1/4,000 from 1/10,000 and the amount received from rushes are now 40% of what they were. Results in the same drops long term, but rushes are more frequent.
- Decreased the frequency of legendary/mythical rushes and increased the amounts. This keeps these rushes rare and big at roughly the same values as before the above change.
- Lowered the Resource Rush gathering upgrade to account for the rush changes.

Heroic Shards
-------------

- Heroic Shards are now tradable.
- You can now use Heroic Shards via the "Manage Upgrades" section. These function exactly the same as Heroic Potions, increasing your gold/resource gains, but for every 10 upgrades the cost increases by 1 shard.

Misc
----

- Increased Labyrinth exp. Especially significant at lower levels.
- Increased the base amount by 25% and significantly increased the curve of Gold drops from Action Bonus.
- Epic Trinket drops are no longer global.
- Epic Rune crafts are no longer global.
- Epic Emerald crafts are no longer global.
- Adjusted the descriptions of Heroic Potions and Heroic Shards.
