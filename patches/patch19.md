Trinkets
--------

- Attributes % gain is now displayed correctly.

Rushes
------

- Each Gold Rush/gathering mastery changed to a static 1/10,000 chance, and a base multiplier of x500. Each mastery point now increases the base multi by 1%.
- The gathering upgrade resource rush increases the base rush amount by 3.
- Each rush now has a rarity. Standard rushes are rare, epic are x3, legendary are x15 and mythical are x40. Legendary and mythical give globals.

Bosses
------

- Boss health now has a base of 5,000,000 plus 100,000 for each level.
- The damage you do to a boss is now solely based on your natural attribute levels. Although counterintuitive, the damage comes from the sum of your health, attack and defence values to make all attributes relevant when fighting bosses.
- The damage cap remains at 0.5% however this is now extremely difficult to reach.
- Gold now scales with damage and was significantly increased.
- Rare and higher bosses give more gold: 5%/10%/20%/35%.
- You can now attack bosses with 10% health remaining (was 20%).

Gathering
---------

- The Gathering Upgrade level was changed as follows:
-- Now gives +10% shards per level
-- Milestones removed and now gives a flat +0.1% chance of double shards per level.
-- The curve on Tool bonuses flattened significantly, resulting in lower gains on the higher levels as this was significantly overpowered.

Bonus Time
----------

- Bonus Time can now be given randomly on average of once every 3 days of 1 hour. There is a 70% chance for the duration to increase by 1 hour, which keeps rolling until a failing roll.
- When bonus time is given by an admin or rng, the modifier is no longer affected.

Heroic Potions
--------------

- Heroic Potions now provide +1% to Gold and +1% to Resources. They no longer contribute to resource rushes.
- The cap was raised to 82. The sum of both batting heroic doses and gathering heroic doses were added together. Any excess were refunded to your account as Heroic Potions.

Misc
----

- Increased the chances of receiving higher credit drops on clan rushes past level 500 Clanmanship.

NOTE: Celestial trinkets were added but since I have not yet finalised their upgrade costs they are delayed until next patch, coming soon.
