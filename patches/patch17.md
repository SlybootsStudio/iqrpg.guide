Labyrinth
---------

- You now get slightly more Artisan Shards for reaching higher labyrinth rooms.
- The Artisan Shard drop was increased slightly.
- Artisan Shards (both dropped and reward for final rooms) are now modified by your minimum skill level if your minimum skill level is 100 of higher. Examples: 1.7% boost at level 100, 10.6% boost at level 105, 55% boost at level 125.
- You can now use your Artisan Shards to upgrade an Artisan Shrine (from the Labyrinth home page - the cost starts at 12500 shards and increases by 500 per level) which gives the following bonuses per level:
-- +1% to gold (from mobs and bosses).
-- +1% to resources.
-- +2% to all exp gains from all sources.
-- -0.01s to the action timer when crafting.
- The bug which caused your current room progress to carry over to the following day was fixed.

Raids
-----

- Replaced the Alchemy Merchant 50-60k Gold drop with 1-2 Tree Sap.
- Replaced the Traveling Merchant 60-80k Gold drop with 2-5 Tree Sap.
- Added an 11-14 Tree Sap drop to the Master Alchemist's Hut.

Events
------

- Increased the chances of a gathering event spawning, and increased the chances of the event being of a higher rarity.
- Increased the chances of a boss spawning, demon horn sounding and increased the chances of the boss being of a higher rarity.

Notes
-----

The next update will feature a new system for crafters. Three new account-bound items will be released that will give various bonuses. Each of the 3 crafting skills will be used to upgrade these items. More details will be released soon but patch can be expected to launch on February 26th. Or bonus time until patch.
