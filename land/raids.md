# Raids

`Land` &rarr; `Raids`

You can run one raid at a time. Raids progress even if you're offline. Raids cannot be paused. Cancelling them will have you lose your progress. Each land level has one scouted raid type associated with it.

> **New players** should try to get to a Village ( Level 3) to unlock the **Warehouse**, the 8-hour standard raid. You should always have a raid running. When you can, run **Scouted** raids before **Standard** raids.

## Standard Raids

These raids are always available. There are three of them which all reward gathering resources.

| Name | Land (Level)	| Duration (Hours) | Reward Type |
| ---- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Storage Container | Camp (1) | 2.5 | Gold, Resources
| Warehouse | Village (3) | 8 | Gold, Resources
| Large Warehouse | Village (5) | 24 | Gold, Resources

## Scouted Raids

These are one-use raids, which go away upon completion or cancellation. They are refreshed each day at 00:00 game time. Scouted raids should be run before standard raids, as the rewards are much better.

| ---- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Component Merchant | Camp (1) | 1.5 | Weapon, Armor, Tool Components
| Alchemy Merchant | Small Village (2) | 1.5 | Alchemy Components

## Rarity

As of *Update 11*, all raids are common. Raid rarity is influenced by your **Scout** Level (see Personnel).  Rarity will also influence the total drops for a completed raid (see below).

- Each *land level* decreases the chances of lower level raids.
- *Scout level* decreases the chances of lower level raids as well as increasing the chances of higher rarity raids.
- *Scout rarity* increases the chances of higher rarity raids.
