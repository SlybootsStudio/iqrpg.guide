# User Scripts

[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is a browser extension which can run scripts on web sites. Commonly, web games will have player-made scripts to augment the experience of playing a game, typically within the bounds of the terms of a service of a game.

[Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts?q=iqrpg) is a repository of scripts that work in Tampermonkey.

## Audio Script

### [IQRPG+ (v0.1.8)](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/532428-iqrpg-combined)

#### Adjusting Volume

This has some loud or startling sounds when certain events occur. Often times folks edit the script and set the audio files to more simple beeps.

Go into the code and you can set audio between 0 and 1 line 65,

```javascript
var masterAudioLevel = .3;
```
