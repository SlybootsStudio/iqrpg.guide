# User Scripts

[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is a browser extension which can run scripts on web sites. Commonly, web games will have player-made scripts to augment the experience of playing a game, typically within the bounds of the terms of a service of a game.

[Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts?q=iqrpg) is a repository of scripts that work in Tampermonkey.
