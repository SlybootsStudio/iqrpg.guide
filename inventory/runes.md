# Runes

`Home` &rarr; `Runes`

> **New players** For battlers, new players should equip these as soon as possible. Keep in mind you can upgrade your runic belt to equip a second rune for less than the price of a Training Rune 4, so pretty early on you'll want two runes.
>
> For gatherers, runes would be a late-game upgrade. They are expensive and you would find less expensive bonuses with jewels or premium boosts. You should focus on premium Drop and Resource boost before Runes.

## Runecrafting Skill Bonus

Your runecrafting level will give a boost to the buff on your runes. The runes do not need to be self-crafted to get this boost. The boost applies to all stats, including the resource.

As of Patch 13, Runes and Jewels now gain a +0.5% bonus to their attributes for every level you have in the relevant skill over 60. At level 100, you'll have a +20% bonus to their attributes.

| Level | Boost
| ---- | ------
| 60 | 0%
| 80 | 10%
| 100 | 20%
| 120 | 30%
| 140 | 40%
