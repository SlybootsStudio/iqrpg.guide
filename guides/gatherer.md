# Gatherer Guide

by Kalesaur

## Quick guide

- Upgrade tool and boosts.
- Repeat.

## Premium store

- res boost = drop boost > exp > mastery
- Max each boost before moving on to the next

## Gathering upgrades

If noob:

- res% > exp > double drop > res rush

If not noob, then pick one of these. Both are good.

- res% = exp > res rush > double drop > rarity (evelyn)
- res% > exp = res rush > double drop > rarity (ducktorlarsen)

## Masteries

- Gathering equal with [mining OR woodcut OR quarry]
- Once you find a clan, clanmanship should be on par with gathering. Assuming you are not in a dead clan. Consult with your clan regarding donations, rushes, etc.

## Trinkets

- Base res >>> res boost = drop > exp > double drop > mastery > rarity

## Main ways to improve income


### Simplified res formula

> res per action = (base res) \* (res boost) \* (other boost)

Therefore you want to maximize `base res`, `res boost`, and `other boost`.

### Base res

- Tool

### Resource boost

- Premium store
- Trinkets
- Clan

### Other boost

- Tool
- Jewels
- Runes
- Land
- Heroic pots
- Skill shards

### Base res vs res boost

Base res is always better than res boost. You will have more res boost than base res, which means that an increase to base res will boost your income more.

### Detailed res formula

> (Base + Base Resources) \* (Tool + Skill Shard + Heroic + Land + Jewels + Runes) \* (Premium + Clan + Trinket) \* Global

- Gathering pot is part of premium. Do the math and only use if profitable for you.
