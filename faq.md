# FAQ

## General

### How do I get `item`?

Most items can be obtained in the `Market`. 

Prices flucuate and inflate over time, as the income of players increases. This can make it difficult for new players to obtain certain items, however it also means the items that players find are worth much more.

For example, at the end of 2023, **Sandstone** was selling for 500,000 gold. In 2020, it was 5,000.

### How do I make more gold?

- Sell your drops! These include keys, stones, gems, ingredients, and tool/weapon/armor components. As a newbie you will not have much use for them. Obviously if you need the components to improve your main skill then don't sell them.
- Pay IRL $$$
- X-trade in from other games.
- I won't lie to you, the early game is tough. It takes a bit of gold to make more gold. Stick to it and you'll slowly progress. It's an idle game after all. Marathon, not a sprint.


## Market

### Do I use `Buy Order` or `Sell Order`?

* If you need the iem immediately, you can fulfilling a Sell Order.
* If you don't need the item immediately, you can place a Buy Order. You must wait until someone with the item decides to sell it to you.

You will end up paying more gold for the item to receive it immediately, and you don't have to compete with other Buy Order bidders.

You cannot have a Buy and Sell Order up at the same time.

### What is market *flipping*?

A practice where you buy the item for a lower price, then resell it for a higher price. It takes minimal effort to generate gold for yourself. While this is allowed, it is commonly looked down upon by players and clans.


## Why can’t I equip this jewel?

    
You have to unlock the jewel slot. `market`>`token store`>`jewel slots`

### How do I join a clan? Why isn't anyone accepting me?

Advertise in `trade` chat. Clan membership slots are expensive, so clans are looking for active players who are progressing their characters. It isn't uncommon for days, or even weeks, before clan membership becomes available.

### How do I get credits?

- `market`>`black market`. You can purchase about 75 bound credits before reaching market price. You will want to buy these each month before turning to the market. See [blackmarket](market/blackmarket.md) for more info.
- market. Current market price is about 2m gold each, give or take.
- \$$$

### What are `autos`?

**Automatic Actions** represent what your character is doing and are displayed in a bar at the top of the game. Each action takes six seconds, and the count represents the amount of actions you have until you must refresh the count.

The count is refreshed by clicking directly on the bar, clicking on the `Quick Links` for Battle, Mining, Woodcutting, etc. Or by going to a page in the navigation and selecting an action there (Battling, crafting, etc).

Engaging with the inventory or market does not refresh actions.

### How do I get more `autos`?

1. Each clan has an `Autos Totem`, which provides a 2% bonus per level.
2. Your `Land`, will give you 10 autos per upgrade.
3. Directly buying autos through the `Premium Store`, using bound or unbound credits. The price per auto increases at certain thresholds (more details on the Premium page).
4. You can use a `Minor Autos Potions` to temporarily gain 300 actions (30 minutes). These can stack.

### How many autos should I buy?

Your goal should be to remain as active as possible. Having more actions per day increases your progression, your income, and your likelihood of being recruited into a clan.

If you are able to be at your device often, and refresh actions often, then you generally won't need as many as someone who can't be as attentive to refreshing their actions. Buy as many autos as you need to try to remain as active as you can.

For example, if you can only check in once an hour, then having at least 600 autos would be good. If you can only check in every two hours, then you'd want at least 1,200 autos.

### The Sewer combat area says says 15% component drop chance but I haven’t gotten a single drop!

The base drop rate is 1 per 100 action for a `drop` to occur. 
Your actual drop rate is much lower (base of 1/100). A 15% component drop chance means that if you get a drop, there is a 15% chance that drop will be components.

### Best equipment ratio for battlers?

Keep equipment type equal. Early to midgame, keep weapons ~10 levels above armor. Late game, have weapons and armor at equal levels.

### How to decide whether to upgrade equipment type or level?

- If the component cost is slightly higher than the gold cost, upgrade type. Otherwise upgrade level.
- Basically, weapon 10 levels above armor, and for types just whatever to keep the costs equal-ish

### What is armor cap?

You can only reduce incoming damage to 20%. After that, nothing happens no matter how much more defense/armor you stack.

Armor cap exists because otherwise you'd just go all in on armor and go fight big mobs and be immortal.

You know you've hit armor cap when you upgrade armor and damage you take doesn't seemingly change. (RNG still exists)

### Should I "chop the spirit tree"? "quarry the sinkhole"? "mine the meteorite?”

Yes. These events have higher drop rates for tool comps and drops.

### How do I send stuff to other people?

- `Market > send items`
- Or double click on their name in chat and click “send items”.

### What are the rarities?
    
<span style='color:white'>Common</span> ⇒ 
<span style='color:#2f2'>Uncommon</span> ⇒ 
<span style='color:#55f'>Rare</span> ⇒ 
<span style='color:#ff0'>Epic</span> ⇒ 
<span style='color:#f70'>Legendary</span> ⇒ 
<span style='color:red'>Mythic</span> 

### How do I get trinkets?

Trinkets are random drops. The chance to receive a trinket per action is incredibly small, so don't be dismayed if you aren't getting any. You can increase drop rate/rarities by upgrading your Treasure Hunter (`Land` > `Personnel`). See [Personnel](land/personnel.md) for more info.

### Is my trinket good?

- Battler
    - Base gold >>> gold% > attribute > stats
- Gatherer
    - Base res >>> res boost = drop > exp > double drop > mastery > rarity

Trinkets are considered mid-end game investments. So don't worry too much about them if you are new. Just equip whatever trinkets you get and replace them when you find better ones. Because trinkets takeactions to drop, consider upgrading Treasure Hunter a bit. Scout still better because it's a sure return on investment though.

### What is my power level?

The game does not tell you. But you do not need to know it. When battling, aim for 98%-99% win rate. Set it to a mob, clear your Action Tracker, and come back in a few minutes to see your win rate.

You are strong enough to clear a dungeon if you can defeat a mob of similar power level.

- For example, Mountain Dungeon mobs are power level 700. If you are able to defeat skeletal mages (powerlevel 770), you should be OK in the Mountain Dungeon.

### What does each mining/woodcutting/quarrying level do?

At certain level milestones, you unlock new possible drops. For a detailed droptable, go to the in-game tab `Gathering`, and click on each gathering type.

### What does battling level do?

- Each battling level gives you more hp.
- "Battling levels over 100 now contribute towards gold gains. Each level has an exponential increase, starting at 0.22% at level 101, rising to 6% at level 120, 23.6% at level 150, 100% at level 200. This is a direct modifier, multiplying gold after all other calculations." ([Update 11](patches/patch11.md))

### What does dungeoneering level do?

- At certain level milestones, you unlock new keys into your droptable. See the key page for more details.

### Should I make a clan?

This isn't something a new player should consider. New clans do pop up from time to time, but often when you become familiar with the game and other players. If you're willing to invest heavily into making a clan though, that is usually a good way to get the attention of an existing clan for why they should recruit you.

### Alchemy tells me "Essence Chance 0.20% (0.000%)". What does the second number mean and why is it red?

That is your level multiplier granted by your alchemy level.

### Trinket drop chance?

Base 1/125000 \* Trinket Drop Chance \* Drop Boost

### What is max roll for Base Resources on a trinket?

On a blue its 2.5
